          This is a global directory of Shopify-run businesses that are Asian owned and operated. For Asian American Pacific Heritage Month, the Asian Employee Resource Group at Shopify would like to celebrate our Asian merchants by featuring them and bringing buyers—new and old—especially at a time where the community is currently facing hardships with both the economy and our identity.
