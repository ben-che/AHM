### Install dependencies

If you're new to development, start by installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a macOS package manager. Paste the following command in your terminal.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

When Homebrew installed, use it to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), a JS dependency manager.

```
brew install yarn
```

After Yarn is installed, use it to install the dependencies.

```
yarn
```

### Run the project locally

Making sure you're in the correct project folder, start the local development server.

```
yarn start
```

In your browser, open `localhost:8000`.
